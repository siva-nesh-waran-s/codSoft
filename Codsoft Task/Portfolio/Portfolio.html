      <h2>Project 1: Design and Fabrication of electrical power generation using treadmill tricycle</h2>
      <p>Now a day’s exercises play an important role in human life. As we know the exercising will reduce the amount 
          of excess calorie of the body and annihilates the metabolic activities of the body. When doing exercise, a large amount of 
          human energy is get wasted. Our project is mainly aim to convert this energy into sufficient form and for making the 
          exercise more convenient by a new design. For that we designed a tricycle where the pedal of the cycle is fully 
          replaced by a treadmill. The treadmill will drive the rear wheels of the cycle via a chain drive, so that its need only the 
          effort of exercising in treadmill to travel a short distance conveniently. A stand is provided to make the tricycle inclined 
          at stationery state and can be use the tricycle as a perfect treadmill. A powerful dynamo and a battery is provided to the 
          rotating parts of the tricycle so that it can produce and store electrical energy during exercising or travelling. We can use 
          this electrical energy in emergency situations such as power failure, it can light some lamps in a room and can give power for music systems etc.
          Key Words: Treadmill, chain drive, dynamo, tricycle.

      <h2>Project 2: IOT based Smart Streetlght Automation and Fault Detection System</h2>
      <p>This is a description of my second project.The IoT (Internet of Things) is a blooming technology that mainly concentrates on the interconnection of devices 
          to one another and the people. The world is getting smarter these days, and people are drawn to the word "Smart". Given that 
          India is one of the world's fastest-growing tech markets, we are incorporating a smart framework into the switch. The 
          project's goal is to provide automatic control and fault detection for street light. The lights are switched ON/OFF 
          automatically based on the intensity of sunlight using the LDR sensor. Automation helps to solve a variety of challenges in 
          both the global economy and everyday life. The power supply which is supplied to the system is converted via Relay before 
          supplying to the street lights. Here the system check’s fault in the street light and also sends the alert message to the 
          authorized mobile number through the GSM module. An object's motion is detected using an infrared sensor. According to 
          the program, if there is any object comes near the IR sensor, the light will glow as bright. Otherwise, the light will glow as 
          dim.</p>
